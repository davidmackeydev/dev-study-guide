# <Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I wanted to create a study guide application, a space if you will, to easily access my notes on topics such as HTML, CSS, JS, and Git.
It will help me with my journey to becoming a computer programmer and professional developer.
As I grow, my hope is that this application will also grow.
I also hope this can help others in their own coding journey.

## Installation

N/A
No installation necessary. Just read along.

## Usage

To use this study guide application, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
